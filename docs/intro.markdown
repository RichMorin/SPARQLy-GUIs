## Goals

The project's goals have to do with encouraging the development
of interesting and useful "recipes" (ie, single-page applications)
that take advantage of public web resources (eg, Linked Data, SPARQL).

A simple recipe might accept some amount of user information,
issue one or more queries, and generate a report.
More complex recipes may support extended interaction.

Most recipes should be easy to use.
If background knowledge is needed, the recipe should provide links
to appropriate resources (eg, Wikipedia articles).

## Development Caveats

Creating or modifying a recipe is likely
to require both study and experimentation:

* The project framework uses a number of technologies
  (eg, languages, libraries, web resources).
  Some of these are complicated, subtle, and/or moving targets.
  Recipes may add other technologies, as desired.

* The project framework uses a number of files and directories.
  Learning where things go takes time.
  Worse, the framework is still under active development.
