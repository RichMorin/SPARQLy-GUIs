### SPARQL template

Each SPARQL query has a fixed function.
In order to use queries for varying tasks,
we need to generate appropriate queries.
We do this by means of a query template,
written in a combination of SPARQL and Handlebars.
Variable information is provided by client-side code,
based on user input, etc.

The following template, in particular, defines several parts of the query:

* definitions for `prefixes`
* the `param` (eg, `populationEstimate`)
* the `limit` (eg, 20) on `rows`
