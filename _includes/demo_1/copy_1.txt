<!-- demo_1/text_1 -->

This page demonstrates a relatively simple SPARQLy GUIs recipe.
It accepts user input, creates a SPARQL query and sends it to DBpedia,
then displays the results in tabular and graphic form.

The query asks for the most populous countries in the world,
based on the `populationEstimate` attribute.
To give the demonstration a try, set the Row Limit (if desired),
then click the "Run Query" button.

<ul>
  <b>Row Limit:</b>
  <select name="limit" id="set_limit">
    <option>5</option>
    <option>10</option>
    <option selected="selected">20</option>
    <option>40</option>
  </select>
  &nbsp;
  <button id="run_query">Run Query</button>
</ul>


## Output

DBpedia's information is harvested from Wikipedia,
which is hand-edited by volunteers.
So, certain values below may be incorrect or even missing.
For example, some of the listed "countries" below may look peculiar
and some expected countries (eg, USA) may not be present.


### Table

<ul>
  <div id="sparql_table">
    This will be a table...
  </div>
</ul>


### Graph

To keep the graph headings reasonable,
we divide the values by 1,000,000 and round the result.
So, for example, a heading of 600 represents
a human population estimate of 600,000,000.
Hover over a bar to see the country name and full population estimate.

<ul>
  <div id="sparql_graph">
    This will be a bar graph...
  </div>
</ul>
